/**
 * <p>
 * Best Practice
 * <li>it's almost always a good idea to use buffering (default size is 8K)
 * <li>
 * it's often possible to use references to abstract base classes, instead of
 * references to specific concrete classes
 * 
 * <p>
 * Commonly used items :
 * <li>Scanner - allows reading files in a compact way
 * <li>BufferedReader - readLine
 * <li>BufferedWriter - write + newLine
 * 
 * <p>
 * Don't use FileReader and FileWriter, because they implicitly use system
 * default encoding, and can't specify by yourself.
